# Hashpipe SETI Data Acquisition

----------------------------------------------
# Basic library dependencies

## [Hashpipe](https://github.com/david-macmahon/hashpipe/)

This is foundational of course.

```
$ git clone -b 44b432af3c88ff6ccd224f526ac2b06674af04a8 https://github.com/david-macmahon/hashpipe
$ cd hashpipe
$ autoreconf -is && ./configure && make
```

## [Rawspec](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/rawspec)
- [ ] Handle lack of rawspec

Hpguppi_daq currently expects this for certain files that aren't always in use:
- hpguppi_rawspec # support
- hpguppi_fildisk_only_thread # Legacy
- hpguppi_rawdisk_thread # Legacy
- hpguppi_ata_fildisk_thread # Contemporary filterbank output

```
$ git clone -b floating_point https://github.com/MydonSolutions/rawspec
$ cd rawspec
$ make
```

[CUDA](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html) is required.

## [SLA](https://github.com/scottransom/pyslalib)
- [ ] ? Absorb into radiointerferometryc99.

Hpguppi_daq uses in only a few critical places:
- hpguppi_params # manage struct meta-data from status key-values
- hpguppi_time # MJD time calculation

```
$ git clone https://github.com/scottransom/pyslalib
$ cd pyslalib
$ make libsla.so
```

# Situational library dependencies

## [UVH5C99](https://github.com/MydonSolutions/uvh5c99)

This library simplifies the authoring of UVH5 files in C. It's a dependency of:
- hpguppi_ata_obs_uvh5disk_thread

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MydonSolutions/uvh5c99
$ cd uvh5c99
$ git submodule init
$ meson build
$ cd build
$ ninja test
```

## [XGPU](https://github.com/GPU-correlators/xGPU)

Correlation is accomplished using xGPU. It's a dependency of:
- hpguppi_ata_xgpu_thread
- hpguppi_xgpu_databuf
- hpguppi_atasnap_xgpu_disk_thread

```
$ git clone https://github.com/GPU-correlators/xGPU
$ cd xGPU/src
$ make clean && make NTIME=32768 NTIME_PIPE=128 NPOL=2 NFREQUENCY=512 NSTATION=16 CUDA_ARCH=sm_86 DP4A=yes
```

## [BLADE](https://github.com/luigifcruz/blade)

Beamforming is accomplished with BLADE empowered threads:
- hpguppi_ata_blade_beamformer_thread

```
$ git clone https://github.com/luigifcruz/blade
$ cd blade
$ CC=gcc-10 CXX=g++-10 meson build -Dprefix=${PWD}/install
$ cd build
$ ninja test && ninja install
```

# Compilation

The `$ ./configure` step determines which threads are compiled and indeed available for deployment.

- [`--with-sla-lib`](#slahttpsgithubcomscottransompyslalib) is required for MJD time calculations. 
Provide the directory containing the library.

- [`--with-blade`](#bladehttpsgithubcomluigifcruzblade) will enable BLADE related threads. 
For this `CXX=g++-10` should be set.
Provide the installation directory of BLADE (-Dprefix defaults to /usr/local).

- `--with-cuda-include` required to compile BLADE related C-API.

- [`--with-xgpu`](https://github.com/GPU-correlators/xGPU) will enable xGPU related threads.
Provide the compilation directory (i.e. xGPU/src).

- [`--with-uvh5`](https://github.com/MydonSolutions/uvh5c99) will enable UVH5 related threads.
Provide the compilation directory (i.e. uvh5c99/build).

All in all:
`hpguppi_daq/src$ CXX=g++-11 ./configure --with-libsla=../../pyslalib --with-hashpipe=../../hashpipe/src/.libs --with-cuda-include=/usr/local/cuda-11.4.1/include --with-xgpu=../../xGPU/src --with-uvh5=../../uvh5c99/build --with-rawspec=../../rawspec --with-blade=../../blade/install`

Thereafter, `$ make` compiles the threads into `$ ./.libs/hpguppi_daq.so`.

# Instantiation

The `init_hpguppi.py` script assesses the `config_hpguppi.yaml` file to achieve the instance-system named as the first positional argument. The script is typically executed with super-user privileges.

# Further Notes

## [rb-hashpipe](https://github.com/david-macmahon/rb-hashpipe)
```
$ git clone https://github.com/david-macmahon/rb-hashpipe
$ cd rb-hashpipe
$ rake package 
$ sudo apt install libncurses5-dev
$ cd pkg
$ sudo gem install --local ./hashpipe-0.6.3.gem -- --with-hashpipe-include=../../hashpipe/src --with-hashpipestatus-lib=../../hashpipe/src/.libs
```
